* Base16 themes for Emacs

[[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16][Base16]] provides carefully chosen syntax highlighting and a default set
of sixteen colors suitable for a wide range of applications. Base16 is
not a single theme but a set of guidelines with numerous
implementations.

This repository contains the Emacs templates and [[http://melpa.org/#/base16-theme][MELPA]]. It can be built
by using one of the builders listed on the main Base16 page.

If you notice anything that looks strange or if this repo is missing
any scheme updates, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull
request.
